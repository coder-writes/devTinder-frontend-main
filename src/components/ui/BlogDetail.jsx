    content: `The MERN stack consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It's a popular choice for building full-stack web applications using JavaScript.
    
    With MongoDB as the NoSQL database, Express and Node handling the backend, and React powering the frontend, the MERN stack allows for rapid development and easy deployment.

    üìå Pro Tip: Start with the backend and set up your REST APIs before connecting the frontend.`,

    content: `Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that allows you to build beautiful UIs quickly.

    üîß Instead of writing custom CSS, you apply pre-defined utility classes directly in your JSX.
    
    Example:
    \`<div className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded shadow">\`

    Great for creating responsive, dark-mode-ready, and highly customizable designs.`,
